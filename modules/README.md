# Workshop Modules

This directory contains the primary content of this workshop. In each of the directories you'll see a README file with explanation, and either submodules or a `config` directory with Kubernete's configuration you can apply directly to your cluster.

See the [repo's root README](/) for a survey of the information in each module and the order we recommend for the modules.
