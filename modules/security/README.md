Security
====

The Istio security features provide strong identity, powerful policy, transparent TLS encryption, and authentication, authorization and audit (AAA) tools to protect your services and data.

In the following labs, you'll add secure ingress gateway and mutual TLS to your deployment. This means that both the client and the server authenticate each otherâ€™s certificates to establish mutual trust.

1. [Terminate TLS at ingress](ingress)
1. [Establish mTLS throughout the mesh](mtls)
