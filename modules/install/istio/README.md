# Istio

In this section we’ll get started with Istio on Kubernetes (K8s). Istio is infrastructure-agnostic and not tied to K8s, but K8s is a great place to run Istio because of its native support of sidecar deployments.

## Installing Istio

Let’s install Istio.

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/istio-demo.yaml --as=admin --as-group=system:masters
```

> We use `--as=admin --as-group=system:masters` to escalate our privilege while installing Istio, which is required to configure the webhook Istio uses to automate sidecar injection. We'll talk about sidecar injection in depth later.

There were a lot of things deployed there so we will break down the important parts and verify that they installed successfully.

Istio extends Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). These enable Kubernetes to store configuration for Istio routing, security and telemetry. Let’s verify they were successfully added. Note, this is an abbreviated list covering the more frequently used CRDs, yours will contain a few more.

```bash
$ kubectl get crds | grep istio | head

```

Next, let’s verify the Istio control plane has installed successfully.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system
NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

prometheus-89bc5668c-crdzs                1/1     Running     0          11m
```

This includes all the needed Istio control-plane components (including Istio Sidecar Injector and Istio Gateways), as well as some companion services such as Prometheus (metric collection Grafana (metrics dashboard) and Kiali (to visualize how microservices on Istio service mesh are connected)

## Installing istioctl

Istio also has its own command line tool for debugging, verifying configuration, manually injecting sidecars and various other things. We can also use istioctl to validate everything has installed correctly.

Download Istio CLI.

```bash
cd ~/
export ISTIO_VERSION=1.1.0
curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -
ln -sf istio-$ISTIO_VERSION istio
```

Add Istio binary path to $PATH.

```bash 
export PATH=~/istio/bin:$PATH
echo 'export PATH=~/istio/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

We can use the experimental `verify-install` command to fully validate that Istio successfully installed. This command may take up to a minute to complete.

```bash
$ istioctl experimental verify-install -f config/istio-demo-auth.yaml
Istio is installed successfully
```
